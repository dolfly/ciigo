=  CHANGELOG

==  ciigo v0.2.0 (2020-07-05)

* all: simplify serving content using function Serve
  Previously to serve the generated content we call two fucntions:
  NewServer() and Server.Start().
  This changes unexported the internal server, and expose only the Serve()
  function with the same parameter as NewServer().

* all: embed the HTML template and the stylesheet
  The parameter for template either in Convert or Generate functions or
  in CLI now become pure optional, not default to "templates/html.tmpl"
  anymore.
  This will minimize steps for user to setup or run the library or program.

==  ciigo v0.1.1 (2020-03-24)

The first release support asciidoc and markdown markup language.

The v0.1.0 release has been deleted because it contains error in the
dependencies and the Go module cache make it even harder to invalidate it.
